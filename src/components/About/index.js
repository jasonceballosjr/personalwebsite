                Hello! My name is Jason Ceballos. Some things about me are that I enjoy playing piano, playing tennis, and I have a passion for technology. I was born in OK but I was raised in Milwaukee almost my entire life. About 98% of it. I love video games, especially the classics like Kingdom Hearts, Shadow of the Colossus, and Minecraft. Thank you for visiting my website!

                My curiosity for technology has been with me for as long as I can remember. From receiving my first console, the PlayStation 1, I was naturally curious about how these games worked. Jumping into the future, I began really diving into technology in high school. This is where I took AP CS and got a deep understanding of Java. I was also on the high school's IT team, managing the networks, hardware and softwares throughout the district. For some reason, I did not pursue technology going into college. I attended UW-Milwaukee for Electrical Engineering for 2.5 years. Due to financial reasons, I could not continue to attend. The week after my last semester's finals, I saw an ad for a non-profit tech/business bootcamp called i.c.stars. Between high school and i.c.stars, technology has always poked at me, giving me random inspiration for app creation, game development, robot making. After being accepted into Cycle 7 of i.c.stars, I finally decided to take the hint from technology and go full throttle. i.c.stars has changed my life, and I've never looked back. Go Lucky Cycle 7!
