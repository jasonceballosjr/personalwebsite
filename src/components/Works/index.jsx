                i.c.stars' rigorous four-month technology training and leadership program offers 1,000+ hours of immersive, hands-on, project-based learning in a fast-paced Agile environment. I was apart of Cycle 7, where I was frequently praised as #1, mainly on the technical front. During my time at i.c.stars, I've established myself as a leader where I have helped almost everyone within the cycle with at least 1 problem, even the staff. Being a resident, my role now is to develope more leaders in the upcoming Cycle 8 by teaching JavaScript, React, and mentoring one of the interns.
